<c.white.bg>(Cory Joseph)</c>
<c.white.bg>My name is Cory Joseph,</c>

2
00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.700  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>and I’m a user experience</c>
<c.white.bgblack>and usability designer.</c>

3
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.740  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>(Chris Higgins)</c>
<c.white.bgblack>And what does that mean?</c>

4
00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:18.260  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>(Cory Joseph)</c>
<c.white.bgblack>I make technology understandable.</c>

5
00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:23.580  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>To get here today,</c>
<c.white.bgblack>I used Uber</c>

6
00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.500  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>just like anyone else would.</c>

7
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.260  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>But on top of that,</c>
<c.white.bgblack>I also used another app</c>

8
00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.200  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>called BlindSquare.</c>

9
00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:36.660  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>I entered in the address</c>
<c.white.bgblack>to Uber and called my ride</c>

10
00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.660  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>just like anyone else would.</c>

11
00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.200  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>But I also entered</c>
<c.white.bgblack>my destination into BlindSquare.</c>

12
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.620  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>And BlindSquare will notify me</c>
<c.white.bgblack>of major intersections,</c>

13
00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.540  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>major points of interest,</c>
<c.white.bgblack>and major address changes</c>

14
00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.480  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>as we’re moving along,</c>
<c.white.bgblack>via voice.</c>

15
00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.200  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>So while I’m in the Uber</c>
<c.white.bgblack>and we’re riding along,</c>

16
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.440  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>I don’t have to just rely</c>
<c.white.bgblack>on the driver knowing</c>

17
00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:06.740  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>where we are.</c>

18
00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.110  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>I actually knew</c>
<c.white.bgblack>where we were as well</c>

19
00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.580  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>because BlindSquare was announcing</c>
<c.white.bgblack>major points of interest</c>

20
00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:14.240  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>and intersections.</c>

21
00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.460  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>And when we were</c>
<c.white.bgblack>at Burnside and MLK,</c>

22
00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.440  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>I knew where</c>
<c.white.bgblack>we were as well.</c>

23
00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.100  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>I wasn’t at the behest</c>
<c.white.bgblack>of the driver.</c>

24
00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.660  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>For example,</c>
<c.white.bgblack>getting here today,</c>

25
00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.300  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>I actually went</c>
<c.white.bgblack>into the dance studio</c>

26
00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.240  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>that’s two buildings over.</c>

27
00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:41.740  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>Walked in.</c>
<c.white.bgblack>Asked the person at the desk,</c>

28
00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.120  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>“Hey,</c>
<c.white.bgblack>is this the right location?”</c>

29
00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:48.360  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>And I was told,</c>
<c.white.bgblack>“Nope. You’re two blocks shy.”</c>

30
00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.020  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>And that’s how I got</c>
<c.white.bgblack>to where I needed to be.</c>

31
00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.440  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>I went to the wrong place.</c>

32
00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.700  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>Sometimes it’s a little bit</c>
<c.white.bgblack>of trial and error.</c>

33
00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.660  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>This concept</c>
<c.white.bgblack>of trial and error</c>

34
00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:08.380  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>is just such a base part</c>
<c.white.bgblack>of my life.</c>

35
00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.960  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>To figure out</c>
<c.white.bgblack>how to take a math test</c>

36
00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.400  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>when I was in grade school.</c>

37
00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.340  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>We didn’t get it right</c>
<c.white.bgblack>the first time we tried.</c>

38
00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.340  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>And we didn’t get it right</c>
<c.white.bgblack>the third time.</c>

39
00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.400  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>It wasn’t until I was older</c>
<c.white.bgblack>and going more through school</c>

40
00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.740  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>that I knew what to do.</c>

41
00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.340  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>There was a lot</c>
<c.white.bgblack>of figuring shit out.</c>

42
00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.420  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>Of course I go</c>
<c.white.bgblack>to the movies.</c>

43
00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.300  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>I really enjoy movies.</c>

44
00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.000  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>Throughout high school</c>
<c.white.bgblack>and college,</c>

45
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.480  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>going to the movies</c>
<c.white.bgblack>with friends</c>

46
00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.380  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>was one of the most</c>
<c.white.bgblack>common things I did.</c>

47
00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:52.820  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>Because, hey, why not?</c>

48
00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:54.620  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>There are movies</c>
<c.white.bgblack>that I haven’t been able</c>

49
00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.500  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>to enjoy as much as others.</c>

50
00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.040  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>Let’s take something</c>
<c.white.bgblack>like </c><c.white.bgblack><i>Avatar</i></c><c.white.bgblack>, right?</c>

51
00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.900  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>There’s elements</c>
<c.white.bgblack>of the visual experience</c>

52
00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.820  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>that are just lost on me.</c>

53
00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:05.300  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>But, of course,</c>
<c.white.bgblack>it’s more than just</c>

54
00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:06.480  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>the visual experience.</c>

55
00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.460  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>There’s the sound,</c>
<c.white.bgblack> there’s the dialogue,</c>

56
00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:09.730  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>there’s the plot.</c>

57
00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.270  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>There’s being there</c>
<c.white.bgblack>with your friends</c>

58
00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:14.190  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>and being able to talk</c>
<c.white.bgblack>about the things that happened.</c>

59
00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:18.280  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>There’s a lot that goes</c>
<c.white.bgblack>into the movie experience</c>

60
00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.660  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>more than video and visuals.</c>

61
00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.900  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>There are movies</c>
<c.white.bgblack>that I just don’t get to enjoy.</c>

62
00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.360  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>Take something like </c><c.white.bgblack><i>Pan’s Labyrinth</i></c>
<c.white.bgblack>that’s in Spanish.</c>

63
00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.460  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>Even though I know</c>
<c.white.bgblack>multiple languages</c>

64
00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:32.830  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>and can see movies</c>
<c.white.bgblack>in Japanese or Chinese</c>

65
00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:36.160  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>or German</c>
<c.white.bgblack>and stumble my way through</c>

66
00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.620  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>listening to them,</c>
<c.white.bgblack>something in Spanish</c>

67
00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.960  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>… can’t do.</c>
<c.white.bgblack>Can’t enjoy at all.</c>

68
00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:44.840  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>And </c><c.white.bgblack><i>Pan’s Labyrinth</i></c><c.white.bgblack> would be</c>
<c.white.bgblack>a great example of one that,</c>

69
00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.880  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>hey, it’s award-winning.</c>
<c.white.bgblack>My friends have seen it.</c>

70
00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.860  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>They talk about all the things</c>
<c.white.bgblack>that happened.</c>

71
00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.090  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>And I’m totally at a loss</c>
<c.white.bgblack>because I can’t read subtitles.</c>

72
00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:55.500  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>I couldn’t go see it.</c>

73
00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.160  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>I can’t download a movie</c>
<c.white.bgblack>that’s subtitled on iTunes.</c>

74
00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.910  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>And if I do download</c>
<c.white.bgblack>a movie that’s subtitled</c>

75
00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:04.840  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>and I didn’t know it,</c>
<c.white.bgblack>well, that’s five bucks I’m out.</c>

76
00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.680  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>It’s one thing to acknowledge,</c>
<c.white.bgblack>oh, yeah,</c>

77
00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.880  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>blind people want</c>
<c.white.bgblack>to read my blog.</c>

78
00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:13.900  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>It’s another thing</c>
<c.white.bgblack>to actually make your blog</c>

79
00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.040  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>readable by blind people.</c>

80
00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:20.170  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>It’s one thing to say yes,</c>
<c.white.bgblack>people in wheelchairs</c>

81
00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:22.220  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>want to shop at Walmart.</c>

82
00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:25.650  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>It’s another thing</c>
<c.white.bgblack>to actually figure out</c>

83
00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:27.800  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>how and where</c>
<c.white.bgblack>to put the ramp,</c>

84
00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.170  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>what incline the ramp</c>
<c.white.bgblack>needs to be,</c>

85
00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:32.070  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>where’s the best place</c>
<c.white.bgblack>to put the door</c>

86
00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:34.970  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>that the ramp goes to.</c>

87
00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:38.440  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>These are two</c>
<c.white.bgblack>very disparate areas,</c>

88
00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.140  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>in my point of view.</c>

89
00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:42.300  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>There’s the consideration;</c>
<c.white.bgblack>then there’s the actual</c>

90
00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.400  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>implementation in design.</c>

91
00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:50.560  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>You design for accessibility,</c>
<c.white.bgblack>and you build for usability.</c>

92
00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:54.500  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>These two distinct areas</c>
<c.white.bgblack>cross over,</c>

93
00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.100  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>where there’s all</c>
<c.white.bgblack>of these details</c>

94
00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:59.580  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>that we need</c>
<c.white.bgblack>to consider as designers.</c>

95
00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:03.780  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>But as creators,</c>
<c.white.bgblack>we have a responsibility</c>

96
00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:10.180  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>to create in a way</c>
<c.white.bgblack>that takes all those considerations</c>

97
00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:12.180  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>and actually brings them to life.</c>

98
00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:17.340  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>Ten years ago,</c>
<c.white.bgblack>if I wanted a phone</c>

99
00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:21.700  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>that I could use</c>
<c.white.bgblack>as a digital assistant,</c>

100
00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:26.000  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>it required a special phone,</c>
<c.white.bgblack>with special software,</c>

101
00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.660  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>that cost over $1,000</c>
<c.white.bgblack>just for the software.</c>

102
00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:32.860  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>Now, ten years later,</c>
<c.white.bgblack>we’re at a point</c>

103
00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:38.260  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>that I can walk</c>
<c.white.bgblack>into any cell phone carrier</c>

104
00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:44.760  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>and buy nearly any phone</c>
<c.white.bgblack>and be able to use it</c>

105
00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:46.720  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>right then and there.</c>

106
00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.260  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>As a visually impaired person,</c>
<c.white.bgblack>I use a screen reader</c>

107
00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:55.920  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>on my phone called VoiceOver.</c>

108
00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:58.680  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>I also sometimes use</c>
<c.white.bgblack>an Android device,</c>

109
00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:01.720  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>and I use TalkBack on that.</c>

110
00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:04.700  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>For this example,</c>
<c.white.bgblack>I’m going to show VoiceOver.</c>

111
00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:08.260  align:center  line:-1

<c.white.bgblack>a text message.</c>

165
00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:10.140  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>Of course,</c>
<c.white.bgblack>like all technology,</c>

166
00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:12.370  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>there’s a time and place</c>
<c.white.bgblack>for everything,</c>

167
00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:17.520  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>and speech is great</c>
<c.white.bgblack>for most of how I use</c>

168
00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:19.680  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>my mobile device.</c>

169
00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:22.280  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>But when I’m on a meeting</c>
<c.white.bgblack>or on the bus,</c>

170
00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:25.060  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>or on the train,</c>
<c.white.bgblack>or at a coffee shop,</c>

171
00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:27.630  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>there’s a lot of times</c>
<c.white.bgblack>I don’t want to use speech</c>

172
00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:30.800  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>or have to wear headphones</c>
<c.white.bgblack>to listen to that speech.</c>

173
00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:36.260  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>So I use a device</c>
<c.white.bgblack>called a braille display</c>

174
00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:40.200  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>that will show</c>
<c.white.bgblack>what would normally</c>

175
00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:44.260  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>be spoken in braille</c>
<c.white.bgblack>along a braille display.</c>

176
00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:58.920  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>I can even operate</c>
<c.white.bgblack>the entire device</c>

00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:02.180  align:center  line:-1

00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:16.340  align:center  line:-1

<c.white.bgblack>So my watch is actually</c>

182
00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:19.520  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>really unique</c>
<c.white.bgblack>because it’s tactile</c>

183
00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:23.040  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>in a way that,</c>
<c.white.bgblack>as a visually impaired person,</c>

184
00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:25.240  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>I can read it</c>
<c.white.bgblack>with my fingers</c>

185
00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:28.420  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>by feeling the marble</c>
<c.white.bgblack>on the front of the face</c>

186
00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:29.960  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>and the tick marks,</c>

187
00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:35.040  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>and the marble</c>
<c.white.bgblack>on the side of the bezel</c>

188
00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:37.040  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>and the tick marks,</c>
<c.white.bgblack>to read minutes</c>

189
00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:39.480  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>and hours, respectively.</c>

190
00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:43.160  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>It’s really unique</c>
<c.white.bgblack>because it was a design project</c>

191
00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:48.860  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>from a military vet</c>
<c.white.bgblack>that actually wanted something</c>

192
00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:50.990  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>that looked unique,</c>
<c.white.bgblack>was durable,</c>

193
00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:54.780  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>and was tactile for someone</c>
<c.white.bgblack>who is visually impaired.</c>

194
00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:57.320  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>The idea for this watch</c>
<c.white.bgblack>is really straightforward:</c>

195
00:09:57.320 --> 00:10:02.180  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>it’s something that looks good</c>
<c.white.bgblack>and is usable by everyone.</c>

196
00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:04.500  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>I’m not asking</c>
<c.white.bgblack>for something special</c>

197
00:10:04.510 --> 00:10:06.210  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>so that I can use the thing.</c>

198
00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:10.050  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>I’m asking for the thing</c>
<c.white.bgblack>to be usable or accessible</c>

199
00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:11.980  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>from the get-go.</c>

200
00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:17.420  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>I think developers</c>
<c.white.bgblack>at a base level</c>

201
00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:20.680  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>know what accessibility is.</c>

202
00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:22.740  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>I don’t think they know</c>
<c.white.bgblack>that they have to do</c>

203
00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:26.500  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>anything differently</c>
<c.white.bgblack>to make something accessible.</c>

204
00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:30.420  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>It goes back to when</c>
<c.white.bgblack>we were first learning</c>

205
00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:34.460  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>how to handle data privacy</c>
<c.white.bgblack>and data security.</c>

206
00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:37.360  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>There was a time</c>
<c.white.bgblack>when personal data was stored</c>

207
00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:39.080  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>as plain text in databases.</c>

208
00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:40.960  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>We had to learn</c>
<c.white.bgblack>that these things</c>

209
00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:44.720  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>couldn’t happen like that</c>
<c.white.bgblack>because it wasn’t secure.</c>

210
00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:46.450  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>Same thing with accessibility.</c>

211
00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:49.100  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>We have to learn</c>
<c.white.bgblack>the best practices</c>

212
00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:54.780  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>that makes what we’re building</c>
<c.white.bgblack>accessible from the get-go.</c>

213
00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:58.540  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>And right now I don’t think</c>
<c.white.bgblack>developers are taught</c>

214
00:10:58.540 --> 00:11:02.400  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>that accessibility is something</c>
<c.white.bgblack>they should be concerned with</c>

215
00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:05.620  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>from a very early point</c>

216
00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:07.720  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>From a basic</c>

<c.white.bgblack>“Yes, you have access</c>

<c.white.bgblack>and organizations are responsible</c>
<c.white.bgblack>to enable that.”</c>

224
00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:33.020  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>Well, when we’re talking</c>
<c.white.bgblack>about all this information</c>

225
00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:38.600  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>that’s, by its definition,</c>
<c.white.bgblack>electronic and managed</c>

226
00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:41.340  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>electronically,</c>
<c.white.bgblack>we have to make sure</c>

227
00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:44.240  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>that everyone can access</c>
<c.white.bgblack>that information</c>

228
00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:45.600  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>as a human right.</c>

229
00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:49.160  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>It makes access to information</c>
<c.white.bgblack>the human right.</c>

230
00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:52.200  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>You know,</c>
<c.white.bgblack>someone who’s really cynical</c>

231
00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:55.640  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>in this conversation</c>
<c.white.bgblack>might say that</c>

232
00:11:55.640 --> 00:12:00.480  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>the call to action</c>
<c.white.bgblack>is to give a shit.</c>

233
00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:05.080  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>But, in reality,</c>
<c.white.bgblack>if you’re making something</c>

234
00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:09.360  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>or creating something,</c>
<c.white.bgblack>of course you give a shit.</c>

235
00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:14.580  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>What I would ask people</c>
<c.white.bgblack>to do is ask themselves,</c>

236
00:12:14.590 --> 00:12:19.050  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>as they are creating,</c>
<c.white.bgblack>making, building, developing:</c>

244
